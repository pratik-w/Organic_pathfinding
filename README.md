 Organic_pathfinding :
 
 Implemented variations of uninformed and informed searches (breadth-first search, best-first search, beam search, and A* search) to recreate "organic" paths (also known as "desire paths") based on human behavior .Searches were performed on given maps to find the right variations of “action-cost” g(s) and “heuristic-function” h(s).
